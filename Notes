cd /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/My\ CI-CD\ project/spc-on-k8s

vi Dockerfile --> edit docker file with new jar file :--
sed -i 's/<  oldfile  >/spring-petclinic-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar/g' Dockerfile

--

docker image build -f Dockerfile -t adithya119/spc:v2 .   ---> name it with new verison v2

docker image push adithya119/spc:v2  

vi spc.yml --> replace old image with new image name :-
sed -i 's/spc-test:v5/spc:v2/g' spc.yml
--

kubectl apply -f spc.yml   --> will automatically do rolling update


kubectl get pods -o yaml | grep image:


kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get svc
kubectl get deployments.apps



-----
Note:-

In interviews tell that you pull new jar from jfrog repo using the ADD command in Dockerfile (you just need to pull & replace old jar path/url with new one)

FROM openjdk:11
LABEL author="adithya"
#saving the jar file in root folder with name "spring-petclinic.jar" because by default any cont is run by root.
ADD https://referenceapplicationskhaja.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar /spring-petclinic.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/spring-petclinic.jar"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------


** Issue troubleshooting **

pods were not running with new jar file:-
pods were going to crash loop back off --> definitely something wrong with the image --> to get to know the root cause, run the container manually in "interactive" mode to see errors :--

# docker container run -it -P --name spc-v3 adithya119/spc-test:v3
Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
        java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/springframework/boot/loader/JarLauncher has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0

you know this error --> it needs newer java version. current docker image's base image is openjdk:11 --> replace it with openjdk:17 or even further latest.
